## Minimum Requirements

1. Create a properly structured child theme based on the Twenty Sixteen theme from Automattic.
2. Include Font Awesome 4 by including this external stylesheet: https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css
	* included in functions.php
3. Using WordPress hooks, actions, and/or filters, add the “fa-icon” Font Awesome icon before the author is displayed and add the “fa-calendar” Font Awesome icon before the publication date is displayed.
4. Provide a custom stylesheet within your child theme. Use that stylesheet to customize the appearance of your child theme. This is your chance to show off your CSS skillset! At the very minimum we would like you to:
5. Apply a decorative border to images within posts.
6. Change the color of the post titles.
	* included in type.scss
7. Modify unordered lists to use the "circle" bullet style.
	* included in lists.scss
8. In a separate JS file within your child theme, add some custom JavaScript that displays some kind of alert or modal when a user has scrolled 500 pixels down the page. Once the alert has displayed once, it should not display again.
9. Include a custom page template for a "Contact" page which includes a simple form to collect the user's name, email, and comment. (Submitting the form doesn't need to actually post the data anywhere.)
10. Include a custom post template called "Post With Recommendations". It can look like the standard post template, but below the post it should include a heading of "Other Articles You May Enjoy" as well as links to the 4 most recent posts to the site. Be sure and provide some styling to that recommendations area as well. The template should be created in a way that allows writers to select your template from the "Template" dropdown in the "Post Attributes" section of the WordPress editor.
