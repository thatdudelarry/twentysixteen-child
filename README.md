#Amply Child Theme
___
___
*2. Include Font Awesome 4 by including this external stylesheet: https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css*

> Including the sheet wouldn't actually include the Font Awesome library (only the CSS directives) so I used the script that the Font Awesome website provided.
___
___

*3. Using WordPress hooks, actions, and/or filters, add the “fa-icon” Font Awesome icon before the author is displayed and add the “fa-calendar” Font Awesome icon before the publication date is displayed.*

> "fa-icon" doesn't appear to be an icon that is available with Font Awesome; "fa-smile" was used in its place.
___
___

*4. Provide a custom stylesheet within your child theme. Use that stylesheet to customize the appearance of your child theme. This is your chance to show off your CSS skillset! At the very minimum we would like you to:*

> Used the default stylesheet used for creating the child theme. Will use SASS to output the sheet.

___
___

*5. Apply a decorative border to images within posts.*

> Did a simple CMYK style offset. Amply provides information, it only makes sense that there would be callbacks to traditional printing.

___
___

*6. Change the color of the post titles.*

> I made them red.

___
___

*7. Modify unordered lists to use the "circle" bullet style.*
